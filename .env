on another note, I have a questions on the unranked 3v3: When you say unranked, you mean that skill should not play any role at all, correct? The alternative way would be very relaxed matching criteria and not showing ranking after the game. Since we have seen both, I wanted to double check. Not considering skill could means your teams are potentially quite unbalanced
